// The human-judgment half of launch readiness. Research into how real launch-
// readiness/GTM frameworks are structured (YC's startup library, a 10-step
// startup launch checklist, Product Marketing Alliance's sales-readiness
// framework, Userpilot's product-launch playbook) turned up categories no
// scanner can check from source: pricing strategy, positioning, support
// staffing, marketing/launch channel, success metrics, legal entity status.
// Those are decisions and processes a founder makes, not code properties —
// launch-readiness.ts's automated scan deliberately does NOT claim to cover
// them. This is self-certified instead of scanned. A bare checkbox is
// gameable (tick it and move on), so items that benefit from it also ask for
// the real answer in a short note — forcing actual articulation is most of
// the signal.
